This is a flashcard generator for helping remember large groups of people.

This takes in a CSV file listing personal details (names, nicknames, birthdays) and an SVG template and generates a PNG file for each person.

This was designed to help memorize the members of an actual family. I've .gitignore'd files with personally identifying information and added example files (the family of 'John Smith') instead.
